Paths through the large and small intestines

large_intestine_path.wlz - a B-Spline representation of the mid-line path
                              through the anatomogram large intestine from the
			      anus to the tip of the appendix
large_intestine_path.jsn - a simple array of points along the large intestine
                           mid-line path
large_intestine_path_map.jsn - map from x-y location to midline path within
                           the large intestine domain
small_intestine_path.wlz - a B-Spline representation of the mid-line path
                           through the anatomogram small intestine from the
			   ileocaecal valve to the gastro-duodenum junction
small_intestine_path.jsn - a simple array of points along the small intestine
                           mid-line path
small_intestine_path_map.jsn - map from x-y location to midline path within
                               the small intestine domain
