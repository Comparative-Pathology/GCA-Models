# [HuBMAPVHM_3D_00070](HuBMAPVHM_3D_00070)

This folder contains the 3D model HuBMAPVHM_3D_00070, version 1.5.

This is a model of the large and small intestines.
The GCA model is derived from the [HuBMAP](https://hubmapconsortium.org/)
visible human male large and small intestine
[models](https://humanatlas.io/3d-reference-library?version=1.1).

This model is comprised of the following files and folders:

* README.md - This file
* HuBMAPVHM_3D_00070.json - the database generated model configuration file
  which defines the way the model can be visualised with the GCA model viewer
  along with the collection of data required to visualise it and the position
  of landmarks with respect to the midline paths.
* Images - There is no pixel or voxel data associated with this model.
* Domains - 3D regions of space corresponding to the HuBMAP model surfaces.
* Paths - Midline paths through the models domains.
* ImageMasks - There are no 2D image masks associated with this model.
* Surfaces - Surfaces derived from the HuBMAP visible human male large and
  small intestine models.
* SegmentedSurfaces - Segmentations of the main surfaces giving surfaces for
  the regions of the model which are typically defined by bounding
  landmarks or other markers on a midline path.
* SurfaceMaps - Surface specific files with per vertex values representing
  the closest point on the corresponding midline path.
* Software - Software specific to the creation of this model.
* Sections - There are no orthogonal section images associated with this
  model.
