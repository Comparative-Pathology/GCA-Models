# Segmented Surfaces

Large and small intestine surfaces segmented into landmark bounded regions

* large-intestine-A-DSJ.vtk - large intestine surface between the anus and the
                              descending sigmoid junction
* large-intestine-DSJ-SF-.vtk - large intestine surface between the descending
				sigmoid junction and the boundary of the
				splenic flexure region in the descending colon
* large-intestine-SF--SF.vtk -  large intestine surface between the boundary
				of the splenic flexure region in the descending
				colon and the splenic flexure
* large-intestine-SF-SF+.vtk -  large intestine surface between the splenic
                                flexure and boundary of the splenic flexure
				region in the transverse colon
* large-intestine-SF+-HF-.vtk - large intestine surface between the
                                splenic flexure region in the transverse
				colon and the hepatic flexure region in the
				transverse colon
* large-intestine-HF--HF.vtk -  large intestine surface between the hepatic
                                flexure region in the transverse colon and the
                                hepatic flexure
* large-intestine-HF-HF+.vtk -  large intestine surface between the hepatic
                                flexure and the hepatic flexure region in the
				ascending colon
* large-intestine-HF+-ICVc.vtk - large intestine surface between the hepatic
                                 flexure region in the ascending colon and
				 the ileocaecal valve-caecum centreline
* large-intestine-ICVc-AO.vtk - large intestine surface between the ileocaecal
                                valve-caecum centreline and the appendix
				orifice
* large-intestine-AO-TA.vtk - large intestine surface between the appendix 
                              orifice and the appendix tip
* small-intestine-ICVi-I.vtk - small intestine surface between the ileocaecal
                               valve-ileum and the junction of the terminal -
			       non-terminal ileum
