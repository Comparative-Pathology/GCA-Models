# Sections

There are too many section images to be tracked on Github so the section
images are only available in model releases. The section images are

* large-intestine-*.jpg - sequential images cut from the grey value image and
                          orthogonal to the path through the large intestine
			  at the ordered points of the JSON path representation
* small-intestine-*.jpg - sequential images cut from the grey value image and
                          orthogonal to the path through the small intestine
			  at the ordered points of the JSON path representation
