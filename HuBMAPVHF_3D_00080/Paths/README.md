Paths through the large and small intestines

* large_intestine_path.wlz  - a B-Spline representation of the mid-line path
                              through the HuBMAP VHF large intestine from the
                              anus to the tip of the appendix
* large_intestine_path.jsn -  a simple array of points along the large
                              intestine mid-line path
* small_intestine_path.wlz -  a B-Spline representation of the mid-line path
                              through the HuBMAP VHF small intestine from the
                              ileocaecal valve to the junction of the terminal
                              and non-terminal ileum
* small_intestine_path.jsn -  a simple array of points along the small
                              intestine mid-line path
